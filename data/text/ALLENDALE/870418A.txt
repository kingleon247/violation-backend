Lead Warning Statement
Many homes built before 1978 were painted using lead-based paint. Lead-based paint is
particularly dangerous if it is chipping or peeling. If home has been cited for chipping paint and this
paint is lead-based paint, it places young children at risk of developing lead poisoning. Lead
poisoning in young children may produce permanent neurological damage, including learning
disabilities, reduced intelligence quotient, behavioral problems, and impaired memory. Lead
poisoning also poses a particular risk to pregnant women. It is recommended that in complying with
this violation notice, you employ lead-safe work practices. If you would like more information on
lead poisoning prevention, contact the Baltimore City Health Department Childhood Lead Poisoning
Prevention Program at 443-984-2460 or the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning by e-mail at
ceclp@leadsafe.org or by telephone at 410-534-6447 or 1-800-370-LEAD.
Property Registration
All non-owner occupied residential dwelling units and rooming units must be registered with the
Commissioner of Baltimore Housing. The Baltimore City Code, Article 13, Subtitle 4-2, requires
every owner of a non-owner occupied dwelling unit, "whether occupied or vacant, whether it is
producing revenue or not producing revenue, whether habitable or not habitable" shall file a
registration statement with the Housing Commissioner. This must be done upon any transfer of the
property and every September 1st thereafter. Failure to register your property in the time and manner
prescribed is a criminal misdemeanor subject to a fine of up to $500 per day. A violation may also be
enforced by Court Order, civil penalty and environmental citation. More information on Property
