Lead Warning Statement
Many homes built before 1978 were painted using lead-based paint. Lead-based paint is
particularly dangerous if it is chipping or peeling. If a home has been cited for chipping paint
and this paint is lead-based paint, it places young children at risk of developing lead poisoning.
Lead poisoning in young children may produce permanent neurological damage, including
learning disabilities, reduced intelligence quotient, behavioral problems, and impaired
memory. Lead poisoning also poses a particular risk to pregnant women. In certain
circumstances you must employ lead-safe work practices to correct paint violations. If you
would like more information on lead poisoning prevention and lead-safe work practices,
contact Department of Housing & Community Development Light Program at 410-396-3023
or the Baltimore City Health Department Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program at
443-984-2460 or the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative by e-mail at
marylandprograms@ghhi.org or by telephone at 410-534-6447 or 1-800-370-5323.
Property Registration
All non-owner occupied residential dwelling units and rooming units must be registered
with the Commissioner of Department of Housing & Community Development. The Baltimore
City Code, Article 13, Subtitle 4-2, requires every owner of a non-owner occupied dwelling
unit, "whether occupied or vacant, whether it is producing revenue or not producing revenue,
whether habitable or not habitable" shall file a registration statement with the Housing
Commissioner. This must be done upon any transfer of the property and every September 1st
thereafter. Failure to register your property in the time and manner prescribed is a criminal
misdemeanor subject to a fine of up to $500 per day. A violation may also be enforced by Court
Order, civil penalty and environmental citation. More information on Property Registration is
available online at dhcd.baltimorehousing.org. The Property Registration & Licensing Office
